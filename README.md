# PyCommerce | DjangoMarketplace

E-commerce project made with Django, focusing on leveraging my backend skills to create financially secure and reliable solutions for business cases of enterprises as well as startups. DjangoMarketplace, or PyCommerce, addresses the need for a fast and accessible web application to kickstart your shop or store in a category of your choosing, as well as various categories.

This web application was built with Django for its fast-paced development compared to other modern tools, using the classic MVC pattern in a monolithic-type application. The web app utilizes a PostgreSQL database locally with Docker, but if you are familiar enough with Django, you can change it to SQLite for development or another type of database.
